# temperance
A library for interfacing astrophysical data with inference of the nuclear equation of state

TODO :
     (1) Get things that were working before working and do some tests
         (a) EoS Sampling
         (b) TOV solving (including getting eos-inf to be a external-internal dependency)
         (c) Envelope plotting
     (2) New Features
         (a) Easier to make corner plots
         (b) Infernce Objects
         (c) Interface bilby -- pipe output directly into likelihood evaluation
